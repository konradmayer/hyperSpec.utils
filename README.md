# hyperSpec.utils

<!-- badges: start -->

[![Project Status: WIP - Initial development is in progress, but there
has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the
public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)
<!-- badges: end -->

This package is a collection of utility functions to work with objects
of the class `hyperSpec` as defined by the package
[{hyperSpec}](https://cran.r-project.org/package=hyperSpec). While it is
independent from the popular
[{hyperSpec}](https://cran.r-project.org/package=hyperSpec) package
(written by Claudia Beleites), `{hyperSpec.utils}` intends to add some
convenient shortcuts for data analysis, some more conversion, import and
export functions, tools for interactive data exploration, as well as
some extended functionality (such as cosmic ray removal). The package
can be considered as work in progress and substantial (also backwards
incompatible) changes are to be expected.

## Installation

You can install hyperSpec.utils from github with:

    # install.packages("remotes")
    remotes::install_github("konradmayer/hyperSpec.utils")
